In order to build for QNX, do the following:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make distclean
    $ addvariant -i OS/CPU/VERSION nto arm so-v7-le
    $ cd nto-arm-so-v7-le
    $ make
    $ make install # optional, see below

You can modify the instructions as appropriate for architectures other than
armv7.

Note that by default this build uses a "build-hooks" file to pass a --prefix
option to configure. This allows "make install" to put all the interesting
libraries and header files in a convenient location. You can of course change
this to a more suitable location should you wish.
